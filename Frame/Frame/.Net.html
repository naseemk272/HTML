<p>
.NET is both a business strategy from Microsoft and its collection of programming support for what are known as 
<br>
Web services,the ability to use the Web rather than your own computer for various services.
<br>
Microsoft's goal is to provide individual and business users with a seamlessly interoperable
<br>
and Web-enabled interface for applications and computing devices and to make computing activities increasingly Web browser-oriented.
<br>
The .NET platform includes servers; building-block services, such as Web-based data storage; and device software.
<br>
It also includes Passport, Microsoft's fill-in-the-form-only-once identity verification service.
